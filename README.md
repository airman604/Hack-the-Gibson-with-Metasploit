# Welcome To BSIDES2019 Hack-the-Gibson-with-Metasploit

This workshop will teach what Metasploit is and its modules. We will then proceed to scanning using Metasploit, dropping payloads and popping a Meterpreter shell, all of this using a custom made vulnerable virtual machine just for this workshop.
We will also cover Metasploit for privilege escalation and pivoting. 

## What You'll Need For This Workshop

* A laptop with VirtualBox or VMWare installed
* A Virtual Machine with the latest Kali installed. This will be the 'Hacker' box. Please make sure your Kali VM works before the workshop
* Custom Vulnerable Virtual Machine that can be downloaded from <virtual machine link>

## Reading Materials

* [How to import existing vm in VirtualBox](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26217_01/E26796/html/qs-import-vm.html)
* [Metasploit Guide By Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/)


### Notes
* Although the authors of this workshop have tested the lab in both VirtualBox and VMWare, the attendees must be prepared to troubleshoot their virtual environment incase there are issues. Help will be provided.
