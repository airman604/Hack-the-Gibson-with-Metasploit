# Welcome To BSides2019 Hack the Gibson with Metasploit Workshop!

This workshop will teach what Metasploit is and its modules. We will then proceed to scanning using Metasploit, dropping payloads and popping a Meterpreter shell, all of this using a custom made vulnerable virtual machine just for this workshop.
We will also cover Metasploit for privilege escalation and pivoting. 

## What You'll Need For This Workshop

This is a hands on workshop and you should come prepared to be able to participate. You will need:

* A laptop with VirtualBox or VMWare installed
* A Virtual Machine with the latest Kali installed. This will be the 'Hacker' box. Please make sure your Kali VM works before the workshop
* Custom Vulnerable Virtual Machine that can be downloaded from [here]()
